I have always been a mac user, but was recently turned onto [Nix](https://nixos.org/#) by my advisor for setting up my development environment this summer. There is much more to say about Nix, but the major philosophy centers around modularity and reproducability, two things that I have come to greatly value through my software development experience.

After getting some more hands-on experience and help with Nix from fellow participants at the [Oregon Programming Languages Summer Program](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer25/index.php) (another post on this forthcoming), I set about to setup this site using Github pages, Jekyll and Nix all on my macbook. Maybe someday I'll make the full switch to linux, but for now I'm committed to macOS and wanted to see how difficult it would be to get things working.

### Topics
- following Chirpy instructions
- getting nix setup
- setting up more nix automations for running jekyll (TODO still) using https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose
