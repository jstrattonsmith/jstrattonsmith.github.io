I am a doctoral student at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science) studying **formal methods** for **software verification** under [Dr. Arthur Azevedo de Amorim](https://arthuraa.net/).

My academic interests are
- programming languages
- logical foundations of mathematics
- theorem proving

I like programming in any of Python, Java, SML, Wolfram Language (Mathematica) and hope to learn Haskell and OCaml soon.

Outside of work I am interested and/or involved in community building, LGBTQ advocacy, vegetarian cooking and board games.
